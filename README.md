# About
cocktailist is a cocktail listing/browsing/rating app built on Rails and Backbone,
created largely to satisfy my own perceived need to keep track of all the bars
and specialty drinks I've had. Users can:

- Create accounts
- Create sessions (log in)
- Create cocktail entries
- Review cocktails
- View cocktail summaries and reviews/scores
- Add cocktails to lists
- Search for cocktails

### Additional Features
- [x] Integrate Google API to Bar info
- [x] Pagination/infinite scroll on the recommendations page/lists page
- [x] "Sticky" the Google map on browse pages to top of screen so it remains in sight when scrolling
- [x] Filter activity feed (3 types: add, rate, and list activities)

##### To do:
- [ ] Add drink type sliders to rating cocktails (adventurous vs traditional, refreshing vs strong-spirited)
- [ ] Browse cocktails by drink type
- [ ] A 2-d graph view of cocktails, plotted out based on drink type (with ability to filter data based on liquor, bar, user list)
- [ ] Extend browse view so user can quickly see what they have listed/rated
- [ ] Get recommendations based on drinking history, and location
- [ ] User profiles and saved preferences
- [ ] Ability to follow users, comment on their activity, compare graphs vs another user, etc
- [ ] Smart search (i.e. autocomplete words)
